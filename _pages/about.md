We were born into an extraordinary world. A compassionate world. A place that was always there for us. It makes us be thinkers, be friends.


Chongfeng Liu is a Robotics R&D Engineer at the </b 2023 Laboratory of Anker Innovations>, where he focuses on translating cutting-edge robotic technologies into practical, high-performance product solutions. His core research lies in the collaborative motion control of intelligent unmanned systems and robots.
He holds a PhD from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. His doctoral work centered on UAV precision takeoff/landing in marine environments — he independently developed an autonomous system enabling UAVs to land precisely via docking guidance with ship-borne robotic arms, effectively addressing challenges from unstable marine platforms and environmental interference.
Since 2013 (undergraduate studies in Mechatronics Engineering), Chongfeng has gained hands-on experience in R&D for diverse robotic systems, including self-balancing scooters, USVs, AGVs, robotic arms, and unmanned sailboats — laying a solid foundation in integrated mechanical design, embedded control, and system optimization.
In his third postgraduate year, he led an entrepreneurial team to develop a seawater COD detection instrument, demonstrating his ability to bridge academic research and market-applicable technologies.
Proficient in classical control theories (PID, fuzzy control), he has rich experience in algorithm debugging and implementation. He is currently expanding into advanced fields like optimization theory, modern control theory, and learning-based control to enhance unmanned systems’ adaptability, robustness, and intelligence in complex environments.
我当前的研究是智能无人系统及机器人的协同运动控制，博士课题为无人机在海洋环境下的精准起降，我构建了一套自主地基于无人机与船载机械臂对接引导精准降落的系统。本科期间从2013年开始，先后参与到多种机器人系统的研发中，包括平衡车，无人船，AGV，机械臂，无人帆船等。研三期间，曾参与创业，并成功研发了海水COD测定仪器。博士期间，主要在多机器人协同的研究工作，参与到扰动环境中无人机/无人艇的协同起降研究中。本人具备算法用于实践的调试经验，熟悉经典控制理论如PID控制和模糊控制等，并开始拓展到优化理论，现代控制论，learning-based control等。
